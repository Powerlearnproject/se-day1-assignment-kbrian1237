      supporting economic growth,
      uplifting other career paths with tools,
      solving complex problems,
      driving innovation


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  -Software Crisis(late 1960's)
    in this period, there was highlights for the need of software engineering as a discipline as software projects were running over budget, xceeding deadline and producing unreliable     softwares.
  -Structured Programming and methodologies(1970s-1980s)
    this era saw the rise of structured programming which promoted modular design, and emergence of models like the waterfall model. This led to the organization and predictability to the software development process.
  -Object-Oriented Programming(1980s-1990s)
    software development was revolutionized following the introduction of concepts like:object, classes and inheritance, wich promoted reusability, modularity and maintainability. languages like c++ and java rose in this era.
  -Agile Methodologies and DevOps(late 1990s-present)
    Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban were introduced, which emphasized on:iterative development, collaboration and feedback


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  -Planning: This is where the big picture comes together. We figure out what the software should do, who will use it, and how it will be used. This phase involves gathering requirements, defining the project scope, and creating a schedule.
  -Requirements Analysis: We dive deeper into the details here. We figure out exactly what the software needs to do, how it should behave, and what features it must have. This phase involves creating detailed specifications, user stories, and use cases.
  -Design: This is where we start to sketch out how the software will be built. We decide on the architecture, the user interface, and the database structure. This phase involves creating diagrams, prototypes, and technical documentation.
  -Development: This is the heart of the process - the actual coding! Developers write the code, test it, and debug it. This phase involves using programming languages, frameworks, and tools to create the software.
  -Testing: We make sure the software works as intended! Testers run tests to find bugs and defects, and then developers fix them. This phase involves writing test cases, executing tests, and reporting defects.
  -Deployment: We get the software ready for the world! We install it on servers, configure it, and make it available to users. This phase involves setting up infrastructure, releasing the software, and monitoring its performance.
  -Maintenance: We keep the software running smoothly! We fix bugs, make improvements, and add new features. This phase involves providing support, updating the software, and responding to user feedback.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  -Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development. Each phase must be completed before the next one begins, making it a structured process. Here are its key features:
    Phases: The process is divided into distinct phases: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, and Maintenance.
    Documentation: Emphasizes comprehensive documentation at each stage.
    Change Management: Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed, making it less flexible.
    Appropriate Scenarios for Waterfall:
    Large Projects: Ideal for projects with well-defined requirements, such as government contracts or large-scale systems (e.g., military applications).
    Construction Projects: Similar to building construction, where each phase (design, foundation, structure) must be completed in order.
    Regulatory Compliance: Projects that require strict adherence to regulations and standards, such as healthcare software.
  -Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that focuses on flexibility and customer collaboration. Here are its key features:
    Sprints: Work is divided into short cycles called sprints, allowing for regular reassessment and adaptation.
    Customer Feedback: Continuous feedback from stakeholders is encouraged, enabling adjustments throughout the development process.
    Collaboration: Emphasizes teamwork and collaboration among cross-functional teams.
    Appropriate Scenarios for Agile:
    Dynamic Projects: Best for projects where requirements may change frequently, such as mobile app development or startups.
    Prototyping: Useful in scenarios where rapid prototyping is needed, like developing new features based on user feedback.
    Complex Projects: Ideal for projects with high uncertainty, such as software for emerging technologies (e.g., AI or IoT).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  -The Software Developer is the heart of the development process, responsible for bringing the software to life. Here's a glimpse into their world:
    Writing Code: Using programming languages and frameworks, developers create the software's logic, features, and functionalities.
    Debugging: They troubleshoot and fix bugs, ensuring the software operates correctly.
    Testing: Developers conduct unit tests to verify their code works as intended.
    Collaborating: They work closely with other developers, QA engineers, and project managers to ensure the software meets requirements.
    Staying Up-to-Date: Developers continuously learn new technologies and programming languages to stay relevant in the ever-evolving world of software.
    Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
  -The QA Engineer is the guardian of quality, ensuring the software meets the highest standards. Here's what they do:
    Test Planning: QA engineers create test plans and cases to thoroughly evaluate the software's functionality, performance, and security.
    Test Execution: They execute tests, identify bugs, and report issues to developers.
    Defect Tracking: QA engineers track and manage defects, ensuring they are resolved promptly.

    Communication: QA engineers work closely with developers and project managers to ensure quality throughout the development lifecycle.
  -The Project Manager is the conductor of the orchestra, ensuring the project stays on track and meets deadlines. Here's their role:
    Planning: Project managers define project scope, create schedules, and assign tasks to team members.
    Resource Management: They manage team members, budgets, and resources to ensure efficient project execution.
    Communication: Project managers facilitate communication between team members, stakeholders, and clients.
    Risk Management: They identify and mitigate potential risks that could impact the project's success.
    Monitoring and Reporting: Project managers track progress, identify issues, and provide regular updates to stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  -Importance of IDEs in Software Development
    IDEs provide a comprehensive environment for writing, testing, and debugging code. They integrate essential tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one application, reducing the need to switch between different programs. IDEs improve developer efficiency through features like code completion, syntax highlighting, and real-time error detection, which help identify and fix errors quickly. They also support various frameworks and libraries, making it easier to manage large projects.
  -Example of an IDE:
    Eclipse: Commonly used for Java development, it offers extensive plugins and tools for software engineering projects.
    Visual Studio: Used for .NET and C# development, providing advanced debugging and profiling tools.
  -Importance of VCS in Software Development
    VCS allows developers to manage and track changes in the codebase over time. It facilitates collaboration by enabling multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each otherâ€™s work. VCS also helps in maintaining a history of changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions if new updates cause issues. This ensures project stability and reduces risks during software updates.
  -Example of a VCS:
    Git: A distributed version control system widely used for its speed, flexibility, and ability to handle large projects.
    GitHub: A web-based platform that uses Git for version control, adding features like issue tracking, pull requests, and collaboration tools.

  -Importance:
    Confirms that the software satisfies user needs and business goals.
    Acts as the final verification before the software is released.
    Reduces the risk of post-deployment failures.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input queries (prompts) to effectively communicate with Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, especially language models like ChatGPT. It involves crafting questions, instructions, or statements that guide the AI to generate relevant, accurate, and contextually appropriate responses.
  Importance of Prompt Engineering in Interacting with AI Models
    -Improves Response Accuracy and Relevance
    Well-structured prompts help AI models generate responses that align closely with user expectations.
    Precise language reduces ambiguity, resulting in more accurate answers.
    -Maximizes AI Efficiency
    A well-engineered prompt reduces the need for follow-up clarifications by providing sufficient detail from the start.
    This leads to faster problem-solving and more efficient AI interactions.
    -Enhances Complex Problem Solving
    Prompt engineering allows users to break down complex tasks (e.g., writing code, generating reports, or creating stories) into smaller, manageable parts that the AI can handle more effectively.
    -Improves Creativity and Content Generation
    For creative tasks like storytelling, designing marketing content, or brainstorming ideas, prompt engineering helps specify the tone, style, and format of the desired output.
    The AI can generate content that matches the userâ€™s creative vision when given clear, descriptive prompts.
    -Optimizes Use of AI Capabilities
    By understanding how AI models interpret prompts, users can tailor inputs to leverage the full potential of AI tools, including summarization, translation, code generation, and data analysis.
    -Ensures Contextual Consistency
    Prompt engineering allows users to provide necessary background information so that responses remain consistent throughout a multi-step interaction.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  -Vague Prompt:
  "Tell me about Python."
  -Improved Prompt:
  "Explain the key features of Python programming for beginners, including examples of how loops and functions are used."
